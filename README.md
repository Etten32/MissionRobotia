# MissionRobotia
It was a fair day in Robotia, the land of robots, and all was going well....

Until that is, Rob Robins came to town.

You see, Rob Robins was a robot robber, and so he robbed away a very important micro-chip containing the code used to program every Robotian Robot, and fled away to his hideout.

If he is left long in hiding alone with said micro-chip, he will no doubt concoct from it, the deadliest virus ever known to Robotia, and will wipe out the nation in the breadth of a nano-second.

Therefore, it is your duty to command this robot through its mission to find and retrieve the micro-chip.

Intelligence managed to mark down where Rob Robins secret hideout is, but they could do no more.

The rest is up to you: Initiating Mission Robotochia....


(This project was an original game idea to practice coding with my students whom I taught Java over Summer.

Please note that the project, which was mostly in planning and diagrams, is now officially discontinued.

Rough system structure plans and diagrams can be found in the "notes" folder, various game information files can be found in the "games" and "missions folders, testing images in the "tileImages" and "unitImages" folders, and what unfinished code was generated is in the "src" folder.)
