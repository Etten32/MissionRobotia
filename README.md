# MissionRobotia
It was a fair day in Robotia, the land of robots, and all was going well....

Until that is, Rob Robins came to town.

You see, Rob Robins was a robot robber, and so he robbed away a very important micro-chip containing the code used to program every Robotian Robot, and fled away to his hideout.

If he is left long in hiding alone with said micro-chip, he will no doubt concoct from it, the deadliest virus ever known to Robotia, and will wipe out the nation in the breadth of a nano-second.

Therefore, it is your duty to command this robot through its mission to find and retrieve the micro-chip.

Intelligence managed to mark down where Rob Robins secret hideout is, but they could do no more.

The rest is up to you....

... Initiating Mission Robotochia....
